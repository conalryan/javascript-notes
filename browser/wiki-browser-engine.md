# [Browser Engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_engine)

- A browser engine is a core software component of every major web browser. 
- The primary job of a browser engine is to transform HTML documents and other resources of a web page into an interactive visual representation on a user's device.
- Browser engines enforce the security policy between documents.
- Implements the Document Object Model (DOM) data structure exposed to page scripts. 
- They also handle hyperlinks and web forms.
- Executing JavaScript (JS) code is a separate matter, however, as every major web browser uses a dedicated engine for this. 
- The JS language was originally created for use in browsers, but it is now used elsewhere too, so the implementation of JS engines is decoupled from browser engines. 
- In a web browser, the two engines work in concert via the shared DOM data structure.
